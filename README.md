# Statistic_methods
This project contains Python implementations of fundamental statistical methods used in probability and data analysis. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts solving various statistical problems with explanations and visualizations
📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each focusing on a specific probability distribution or statistical method:

🔹 Probability Distributions

Binomial Distribution – Modeling binary outcomes and success probabilities.

Poisson Distribution – Analyzing rare events in a fixed interval of time or space.

Geometric Distribution – Measuring the probability of the first success in repeated trials.

Exponential Distribution – Modeling time between independent events in a Poisson process.

Normal Distribution – Understanding Gaussian distribution and the central limit theorem.

🔹 Statistical Methods

Descriptive Statistics – Measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, variance, standard deviation).

Hypothesis Testing – Performing t-tests, z-tests, and chi-square tests.

Regression Analysis – Simple and multiple linear regression models.

Sampling Methods – Random sampling, stratified sampling, and bootstrapping techniques.

Monte Carlo Simulations – Simulating probability models using computational methods.
